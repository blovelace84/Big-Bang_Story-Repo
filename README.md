For my project, I created a short description of the Big Bang. This project is an exercise in what I learned in studying React through Springboard. 
I had so much fun creating this app and am glad to share it with everyone. In the Project, there are two components and one context. The big bng story is 
also displayed in a foreign language known as Klingon.
I started with a LanguageContext to display the setup for the language change. Its features are a createContext to create some context for the text displayed 
in English and Klingon, as well as a useState feature that shows the state of the context when  clicking on the button. 
Moving on, I have two components for the app. The first component is the BigBang, and the second one is the The LanguageController. These two components 
have simple functionalities for the app. The Big Bang shows the text of the story both in English and Klingon. and the LanguageController has a button that changes the language.
Here is the link to the app if you want to check it out: https://boisterous-rolypoly-533b3c.netlify.app/
